## Portfolio Template

Designed with great flexibility, this portoflio can be used as a template! Here's how to set it up:

1. Set up your own [Resend](https://react.email/docs/integrations/resend) API Key as RESENED_API_KEY in a .env file. 
2. In send-email.ts, insert your own e-mail.
3. Insert your own data in data.ts, edit the text in the inner elements, and select a color scheme to your desire.
